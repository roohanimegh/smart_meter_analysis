# Analysis of smart meters in London

There is a UK government led initiative to help tackle climate change by installing smart energy meters in every home in the UK by 2020. In order to test out the feasibility of this, the government carried out a study. Rolling out smart energy meters to a sample in London and recording energy readings every 30 mins from November 2011- February 2014.

The dataset (found on Kaggle), contains a refactorized version of the data from the London data store, that contains the energy consumption readings for a sample of 5,567 London Households that took part in the UK Power Networks led Low Carbon London project between November 2011 and February 2014. The data from the smart meters seems associated only to the electrical consumption.

There is infomation on the ACORN classification details that you can find in this report or the website of CACI.

Weather data for London area was also added, darksky api was used to collect this data.

I used the results from the sample to analyze whether smart meters significantly reduce the energy consumption in London households or not. I looked into how other variables (weather, type of household) effect energy usage between the different meters. This allowed me to conclude (based on this study) whether the introduction of smart meters did statistically change the energy consumptions within households.

This project contains the datasets, the python notebook used to carry out the analysis, along with the presentation used to highlight key findings and conclusions.
